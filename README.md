# Features
## Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is at positioned at the top of the screen across all site pages.
It is fully responsive and collapses into a navigation menu when viewed on mobile devices.
The navbar lets users navigate easily from page to page without having to press the back button.
The navigation links have a rollover effect to turn the link text from white to grey when the cursor hovers over them. This allows the user to easily select the desired link.
Additionally, the current page the user is viewing is indicated in the navbar by the link text turning a solid colour from the default white to grey.

## Footer

The footer is positioned at the bottom of each site page. Its function is to contain copyright information and provide social media links to Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest.

The grey line above the footer separates its involvement from the rest of the page and emphasises the end of the scrollable content.

## Image Carousel
The image carousel is the first thing the user will see when they visit the site. It's purpose is to tell the user about the company and showcase current features, promotions or recent projects through the use of photographic media and captions. The links within the captions hint to the user to explore different pages across the site to learn more information about the services on offer from Wigwam Garden Solutions.

The image carousel is fully responsive to fit all screen sizes. It is controlled via forward and back arrows and will autoscroll left to right but only after the user makes initial contact with the navigation buttons.

## Recent Projects Gallery

The recent projects gallery showcases the company's recent work. It is a space for advertising the diverse range of services that they offer.

The images are fully responsive, showing as a 3x4 grid on desktop and displayed in a vertical stack on mobile.

The images all have a CSS applied zoom transition and the cursor has a rollover effect applied to show a zoom-in style cursor to encourage the user to click on them. Once clicked on, a modal appears showing a larger version of the image with a caption detailing the project and where it was done. 

The idea of this allow the user to explore ideas for a potential project their thinking of for themselves.

The iframe is fully responsive and allows the user to drag, zoom and open the map in a new tab for better viewing.

In future, the testimonials section will contain an interactive iframe from Google Reviews instead of html text.
